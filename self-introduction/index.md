    Hello! My name is Andrey. I live in Minsk (though its getting more and more challenging to live here).
I am 33 years old and, you know, it's not so common to enter the IT world at this age. It’s like I am “too old for rock'n'roll, but too young to die". 
So while I am too young to die, why not try to take my chances?
    Despite the fact that my previous career had nothing in common with IT and programming I still have always been interested in how this all works. 
And the thing I like most of all about programming is this magic: I do something and it works! It has its logic, reasons and results. 
Every task has multiple ways to be solved. Magic. 
    Why RSschool? I like its  fundamental principles like horizontal mutual support,  social benefit to society, possibility of autonomy and self responsibility. 
A beautiful piece of anarchism with its ideas of solidarity and self-management.
    My hobbies are riding a bike and fishing. And before I got married I used to do rope jumping (when you jump with a rope from high objects). 
I made more then 50 jumps and the highest was 105 meters. But since I got married my wife provides me enough adrenaline, so I don't need to jump off skyscrapers anymore. 
Also I have a 7 years old son, and parenthood turned out to be quite challenging and this is another source of adrenaline supply for me.
    I am not a fan of talking about myself. Frankly speaking, it is really the worst thing for me to do. My wife told me it's called social anxiety 
(she is a psychotherapist and so I have to trust her). When I see the camera I feel something like ... (such feeling I have when my wife tells me “We need to talk, honey”). 
So the best thing about my introduction video is that its coming to an and. Imagine, doing this was 5 times more scary than jumping from 105 meters.
Thank you anyway for yourattention.
